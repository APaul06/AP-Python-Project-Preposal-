Protein Weight Calculator with an interface made in Renpy

Main Struggles:
I had to learn Renpy which embarrassingly enough took me multiple days to get the hang of
The files for the game were way too big to upload to the repo so I had to use git to upload it in. Top 10 worst experiences of my life. I have never struggled to understand something so much.
Compromise between functionality and an aesthetically pleasing game given time and resource constraints

What I Gained:
The project was actually really fun.
A new project to put on my resume (although I definitely need to polish it up before I put it out there)
New skills like how to use Renpy and Git

Final Message: I'm glad to have gotten my hand into something that, yes may already exist somewhere, and contributes to the overall field of science and more specifically biology. As a bioengineer hoping to work in biotech, the work I've done for this project is very likely just a fraction of what I'll be applying in my work in the future.

Thank you, Dr. Rosen! I had a great semester and learned a lot.
