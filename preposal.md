# Preproposal

I'm a bioengineering major so I'd like to do something that I could also use as a project for resumes or at least a talking point for the interview.
So I would like to do something bio or chem-related

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Protein Weight Calculator

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I wish to do it alone as I feel like I learn best when I can struggle with problems 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I need to use information from online like example DNA/RNA/Protein sequences. Would I need to cite where I got the information/data from and if so how?
