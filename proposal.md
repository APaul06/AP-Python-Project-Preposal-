# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Protein Molecular Weight Calculator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that allows you to input a series of amino acids and it will calculate its molecular weight of it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program uses a dictionary where each amino acid is mapped to its average molecular weight. When a user inputs a sequence (example: ALA-LYS-ALA), the program splits the sequence into individual amino acids, retrieves the molecular weights from the dictionary, and adds these values to provide the total weight. The program may also display the breakdown of the weight calculation, listing each amino acid and its weight as it adds it up. The user can launch the program, enter an amino acid sequence, and receive the calculated molecular weight as output.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Regardless of constraints I would like to complete the functions of the program that allow for the calculation of the amino acids at the very minimum. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would also include a step by step breakdown of the amino acid weight profiles as the calculation adds up

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything listed above plus a graphic that can generate along side it

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
